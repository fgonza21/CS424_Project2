Our dashboard is based in part on the paper: Jang, Jennifer. Harnessing the power of data visualization to improve cities. Diss. Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 2015 ("the paper"). which dealt with school statistics in the New York City boroughs. 

Our first visualization is based on figure A-7 of the paper.  We used it as a bases to plot shootings throughout the city along with schools and libraries.  From this visualization, one can see the proximity of shootings to schools and libraries to see if no-gun zones have any effect on proximal shootings. 

Our second visualization is based on figure A-3 of the paper. This visualization shows which neighborhoods have more shootings by utilizing shading.  This gives a much cleaner look than the previous visualization, but lacks all the details. 

Our third visualization is a network diagram meant to show the same information, but with community area labels, it is easier for the user to find information on a specific community area. 

Our fourth visualization is a bar graph. Because it is a more familiar visualization, a user can intuitively find the information they need about a particular community area.

We ended up having to do more data manipulation than originally anticipated.  Because school and library information are not given by year, we had to leave that information static.  Although schools and libraries may have open and closed over the 15 year period for which we have shooting data, we feel this still gives a good representation for Chicago over those 15 years. 

We allow the user to select a year in order to view information one year at a time as to not be overwhelmed by 15 years worth of shootings.
